    <h1>The history of Computer and Internet</h1>
    <hr>

    <h2>Early Computers</h2>
    <p>Early computers were massive machines built in the <b>mid-20th century</b>
    , designed primarily for <u>complex calculations</u> and <u>data processing</u>. 
    Unlike today's compact devices, they used <strong>vacuum tubes, punched cards, 
    and magnetic drums</strong>. Though slow and expensive, they laid the foundation for 
    <u>modern technology</u>, <u>inspiring advancements</u> in 
    <i>speed, memory, and accessibility worldwide.</i></p><br>

    <h2>Generations of Computers </h2>
    <p>The generations of computers mark technological progress from 
    <mark>vacuum tubes</mark> to today's advanced microprocessors. First-generation machines used 
    <i>bulky vacuum tubes</i>, while the second introduced <i>transistors.</i> 
    The third brought <i>integrated circuits</i>, and the fourth used <i>microprocessors.</i> 
    The fifth generation emphasizes <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr>, 
    <em>high-speed processing,and advanced software,</em> shaping modern digital 
    innovation globally.</p><br>

    <h2>Mathematics In computing</h2>
    <h4>a famous equation : E=mc<sup>2</sup></h4>
    <h4>another examples regarding this :H<sub>2</sub>O <i>represent water</i></h4><br>

    <h2>Birth of Internet</h2>
    <p>The <abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr> was invented by
    Tim Berner-Lee. As he onced said:
    <blockquote>
        "The web that is envisaged it,
        we have not seen it yet. the future
        is still so much bigger than the past."<br>
            - <cite>Tim Berner-Lee</cite>
    </blockquote>
    </p><br>

    <h2>Modern Era</h2>
    <p>The modern era is defined by rapid technological growth, 
    globalization, and innovation shaping everyday life. 
    Advances in communication, <del>medicine</del>, <ins>transportation</ins> and 
    <abbr title="Artificial Intelligence">AI</abbr> have transformed how people work and interact.
    It emphasizes knowledge, <small>digital connectivity, and sustainable progress,</small>
    marking a shift from traditional practices to a more interconnected, 
    progressive world.</p><br>

    <h2>Computer Example</h2>
    <pre>
       <code>
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
    </pre>

    <p>
        Another example: Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to copy text.
        <br>
        System response: <samp>Text copied to clipboard.</samp>
    </p>
